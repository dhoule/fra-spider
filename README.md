# fra-spider
My first, self created spider. Much testing is needed.

Requirements:
- python3
- Scrapy package - `pip3 install Scrapy`

Future plans`*`:
1. Automated run time of script. Outside of scripts scope, is system dependent.
1. Automatically login to give website(s).
1. Find appropriate data, or look for it, itself.
1. Send needed info back to local system.
1. Send email when done?
1. Check local DB values against values found out in the wild.
1. Update DB values appropriately, if needed.

`*` Will change as needed.
